Java Thread Example
This is a simple Java program that demonstrates how to create and use threads. The program defines a new class MyThread that extends the Thread class, and overrides the run() method to specify the code that the thread will execute when it is started.

This code output shows that the program successfully created a new thread of execution using the MyThread class, and used some of the methods available on the Thread class to get information about the thread.

Specifically, the run() method of the MyThread class overrides the run() method of the Thread class, and simply prints the message "MyThread is running." to the console.

The main() method of the program creates a new instance of the MyThread class, starts the thread using the start() method, and then uses some of the other methods available on the Thread class to get information about the thread, such as its name, priority, and state.
